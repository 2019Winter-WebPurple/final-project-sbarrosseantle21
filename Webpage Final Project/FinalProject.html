        <img src="zahaheadshot.jpg" alt="Zaha Hadid" title="Zaha Hadid" align="middle"/>
        
        <p> Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid DBE RA (Arabic: زها حديد‎ Zahā Ḥadīd; 31 October 1950 – 31 March 2016) was an Iraqi-     British architect. </p>
        <br />
        <p> She was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 2004. She received the UK's most           prestigious architectural award, the Stirling Prize, in 2010 and 2011. In 2012, she was made a Dame by             Elizabeth II for services to architecture, and in 2015 she became the first and only woman to be awarded the       Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects. </p>
        <br />
        <p> She was described by The Guardian of London as the "Queen of the curve", who "liberated architectural             geometry, giving it a whole new expressive identity". Her major works include the aquatic centre for the           London 2012 Olympics, Michigan State University's Broad Art Museum in the US, the MAXXI Museum in Rome, the       Guangzhou Opera House in China, and the Beijing Daxing International Airport, also in China. Some of her           awards have been presented posthumously, including the statuette for the 2017 Brit Awards. Several of her         buildings were still under construction at the time of her death, including the Daxing airport and the Al         Wakrah Stadium in Qatar, a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p>

        <figcaption> The Heydar Aliyev Center is a 57,500 m² building complex in Baku, Azerbaijan designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid and noted for its distinctive architecture and flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles </figcaption>

        <figcaption> The Vitra Fire Station, designed for the factory complex of the same name in Weil-am-Rhein, Germany, was the among the first of Hadid’s design projects to be built. The building’s obliquely intersecting concrete planes, which serve to shape and define the street running through the complex, represent the earliest attempt to translate Hadid’s fantastical, powerful conceptual drawings into a functional architectural space. </figcaption>
